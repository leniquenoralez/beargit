# Beargit
Beargit is a simplified version of git that I completed as a part of [CS61C from UC Berkeley](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/hw/01/hw1.html). You can only track files, there is no file comparison or checking of which line of file has been upated. 

## Supported Commands
```
 * init
 * add
 * rm
 * commit
 * status
 * log
```
